# SmartPlan

With friends, hobbies, and other activities, some people might have a hard time planning their tasks efficiently, especially students. This issue is amplified because of the corona crisis where some people might be demotivated or be less organized due to online classes.


A less organized planning might be the cause of cramming, all-nighters or study sessions replacing moments with your friends, video games and other entertainments and no one wants any of this to happen. This can also add a lot of stress onto the shoulders of students.

SmartPlan helps to overcome these struggles. It helps students plan their schedules based on the priority of each deadline, so that they are well organized and on track. Besides, the app will help students stay focused when studying.
